			<p>"I led EY’s AI Lab in Europe, where I worked with Arun on core client projects for about three years. Thanks to his rich academic and industrial experience on natural language processing (NLP), he played a pivotal role in all our NLP projects, leading some of them on his own and managing project engineers. A particularly challenging project needed a full engineering solution for signing international harmonized trade codes to product descriptions in multiple jurisdictions. Arun designed the entire NLP solution and executed it with his team thoroughly, achieving great success and client satisfaction. His designed architecture was then reused for tackling similar NLP problems in our company. Arun is a technical leader and a great asset for any organization. I cannot recommend him enough!"</p>
