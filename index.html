				<b>Proceedings of COLING 2016</b> by <i>Martin Emms, Arun Jayapal</i> held at Osaka, Japan in Dec. 2016
				- A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for a diachronic model to estimate the parameters from raw
				time-stamped n-gram data with no sense annotation. We are able to demonstrate the inference of
				parameters which plausibly reflect the objective dynamics of sense use frequencies, in particular the
				emergence of a new sense.
