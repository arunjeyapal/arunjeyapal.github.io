		<p>
			Arun is a dedicated spiritual researcher who transitioned into the IT industry, now thriving as a freelance NLP consultant. 
			He holds a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie"></a>School of Computer Science and Statistics</a> at <a
			href="https://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a>, focusing on <i>Finding Diachronic Sense Changes by Unsupervised Methods</i> 
			under the guidance of <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/">Dr. Martin Emms</a> (Sep 2013 - Apr 2018). Arun's comprehensive 
			expertise extends to serving as a reviewer for prestigious conferences like CoLing and EACL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Previously, Arun held prominent roles such as Assistant Director at EY's AI Practices Team (Bangalore) and Data Scientist at Onit India Pvt Ltd. 
			Following his Ph.D., he ventured into a start-up, <a href="https://www.sayint.ai">sayint</a>, based in Hyderabad, where he excelled as a computational linguist specializing in 
			conversational analytics. Arun's proficiency extends to his tenure at Ditech Networks, now Nuance Communications, where he played a pivotal role 
			in de-normalizing ASR outcomes for voice messaging platforms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arun completed his master's degree in Speech and Language Processing at the <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk">University of Sheffield, UK</a>, 
			with a thesis titled "Entity Identification & Co-reference Resolution," under the mentorship of Dr. Rob Gaizauskas. His journey reflects a 
			seamless fusion of academic rigor and practical expertise, contributing significantly to the fields of NLP and AI.

				<b>Proceedings of COLING 2016</b> by <i>Martin Emms, Arun Jayapal</i> held at Osaka, Japan in Dec. 2016
				- A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for a diachronic model to estimate the parameters from raw
				time-stamped n-gram data with no sense annotation. We are able to demonstrate the inference of
				parameters which plausibly reflect the objective dynamics of sense use frequencies, in particular the
				emergence of a new sense.
