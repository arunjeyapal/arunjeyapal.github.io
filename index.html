	<p>
		Arun is a spiritual research professional, however currently working in the IT industry. He has completed PhD from the <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie">School of Computer science and Statistics</a>, <a href="https://www.tcd.ie">Trinity college Dublin</a>. He worked on his thesis titled <i>Finding diachronic sense changes by unsupervised methods</i> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/">Dr. Martin Emms</a> during <i>Sep 2013</i> and <i>Apr 2018</i>. For his complete list of publications, please look at his google scholar <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=YOHTxWcAAAAJ&hl=en">profile</a>. He has also been a reviewer for the CoLing and EACL conferences.
	</p>

	<p>
		Towards the end of his PhD tenure, he came back to India and started working with a start-up <a href="https://www.sayint.ai">sayint</a> based out of Hyderabad. He works as computational linguist on conversational analytics. The recorded contact-center conversations are converted to text by an ASR system and text analytics is carried out on those conversational text. He handles the complete NLP stack carried out for text analytics. Before his PhD, he worked earlier for Ditech networks -- now part of Nuance communications, on voice messaging platform. His role during that term was to de-normalize the ASR outcomes and convert them into human-readable form before delivering the text messages (converted from voice messages using ASR) to the users. Prior this he did his masters from the <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk">University of Sheffield, UK</a> where he did his masters in speech and language processing, thesis titled <i>Entity Identification & Co-reference Resolution</i> guided by <a href="Entity Identification & Co-reference Resolution">Dr. Rob Gaizauskas</a>.

		Off late I have not been very actively pushing my codebases to the github due to privacy reasons. However please do follow up on <A href="https://github.com/arunjeyapal">https://github.com/arunjeyapal</A> to not miss any updates here.

	  HREF="Papers/PP6.pdf">Dynamic Generative model for Diachronic Sense Emergence Detection</A> <b>Proceedings of COLING 2016</b> by <i>Martin Emms, Arun Jayapal</i> held at Osaka, Japan in Dec. 2016 - A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for a diachronic model to estimate the parameters from raw time-stamped n-gram data with no sense annotation. We are able to demonstrate the inference of parameters which plausibly reflect the objective dynamics of sense use frequencies, in particular the emergence of a new sense.
